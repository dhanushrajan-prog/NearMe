    <p>The temple’s most stunning feature: its Vimanam (tower) and Ardha Mandapam are completely covered with real gold — about 1,500 kg of gold foil (applied in many layers over etched copper plates).</p>
    <p>The temple aims to be a spiritual sanctuary for people from all religions and backgrounds — it welcomes everyone</p>
    <p>Visitors often describe it as a place for inner peace, reflection, and calm — the combination of nature, temple architecture, and spiritual path offers a meditative experience</p>
